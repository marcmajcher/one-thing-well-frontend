# One Thing Well

One Thing Well is a todo application that helps you focus on the one thing that you need to (or want to) work on right now. It's easy to look at a long list of items to do and get stuck trying to decide which one is most important or urgent and wind up either fiddling with the list, or get overwhelmed and wind up doing nothing at all. Here, you'll add all of your todos (no matter how big or small) to one "bucket", and OTW will choose one for you at random to focus on. As you use the app, it will try to learn what's more important or urgent for you, and help you get those done, while still throwing you some surprises every now and then.

This is the repo for the front end, and you can visit the hosted app [here](http://some.hosting.service/myapp). The back end repo is [here](http://github.com/itsame/myapp-backend), which documents the API and database schema.
